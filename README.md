# tictactoe
Just a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game for my son Colin. 

You can choose whether you are playing with one player or two players.
If one player, human always is O and always goes first.  Computer (X) will select random empty square (unintelligently).
If two player, assume two humans at terminal taking turns clicking empty square. O always goes first, 
  X will appear when an empty square is clicked AFTER O has clicked for his/her turn.
When either player has completed a row of three, the game will end and a winning message will appear, telling which player 
  (O or X) won the game, or whether it was a tie
Under the winning message is a link to start the game over (back to the 1P/2P selection screen).
Clicking on a square that is already occupied during a game does nothing.

CSS is NOT optimized for larger viewports or mobile devices.  Considering adding those features at a later date.
